# Encryption variables
enc_lat=2385 # encryption latency in nanoseconds
dec_lat=2380 # decryption latency in nanoseconds

# Configurable SSD Controller layout parameters (must be power of 2)
secsz=512 # sector size in bytes
secs_per_pg=8 # number of sectors in a flash page
pgs_per_blk=256 # number of pages per flash block
blks_per_pl=512 # number of blocks per plane
pls_per_lun=1 # keep it at one, no multiplanes support
luns_per_ch=4 # number of chips per channel
nchs=8 # number of channels
ssd_size=12288 # in megabytes, if you change the above layout parameters, make sure you manually recalculate the ssd size and modify it here, please consider a default 25% overprovisioning ratio.

# Latency in nanoseconds
pg_rd_lat=40000 # page read latency
pg_wr_lat=200000 # page write latency
blk_er_lat=0 # block erase latency


Fio Tests:
run with 1 thread, on iodepth of 1, numjobs=1
all reads/writes with block size of 4K (4096 bytes)
log_avg_msec=1000
bwavgtime=1000
None was on steady state for writes, on empty nvme


To read the results text files, they are the following format:
  -random read results
  -random write results
  -sequential read results
  -sequential write results
The reads also have a sequential fill portion.
