First we need relevant inputs for ./run-blackbox.sh. 
The read/write/erase latencies should just be some values taken from modern ssds.
The enc_lat and dec_lat should be taken from the kernel crypto API inside the FEMU guest VM.
They can be gotten by running ./runCryptBench.sh

The following tests need to be run for FemuFDE: 
*All read tests must be after sequential writes
*store all fio tests in this git repo
*maximize the size of the femu ssd
*run all write tests over twice the size of it so we can see steady state
*run all read tests over the size of it - no need to do more
*make sure all the data is logged so it can be graphed like the earlier lab
*graph both the latencies and bandwidth
*put the command line results in results.txt and make sure to put all the 
    logs and graphs in this git repo

sequential writes
sequential reads
random writes
random reads

All of those tests must be run with the following setups
*luks encryption should use standard xts aes with 512 bit key

basic ramdisk (just femu with no latencies)
    -with no encryption, with femu tweak encryption, with femu tweakless encryption, with luks encryption
basic femu read and write latencies (from looking the average values up)
    -with no encryption, with femu tweak encryption, with femu tweakless encryption, with luks encryption


Should be 32 total tests so might take a while. I would just put the four fio run commands
    in a bash.sh file so they can autorun for each setup.
